I've worked in advertising for far too long, and I've worked with design, copy and strategy.
However, I started off as an engineer and have always been fascinated with code (starting off 
with C and 8085 micro-processor programming).
For this reason, I'll love to have a goal to eventually become a full-stack 
developer who can prototype ideas and make them come to life. 
Hopefully.
